## Motivation:
### I am a 23-year-old self-taught musician. That, as the title states, learned all that I know by myself. It was a challenging journey and would have loved to had a place to learn and be motivated from the start of it all. As a semi-professional musician, I get asked if I teach, and I do not have all the time that I would love to have to teach everyone, so I decided to make this website. To send all my friends and family here to help them kick off this journey that I would never that I would take back ever in my life. Playing guitar is probably my number one passion and love to do this. I chose "Above Reality" as the name of the website because learning guitar is surreal. There's a lot in it that most people do not understand. Once you recognize the reality of learning, the sky is the limit when playing an instrument, and we learn more and more every day as we practice and learn guitar.
